# MUI and React single-page project

<p>This is one small project that I made with my colleagues during the React marathon at SoftServe academy.</p>
<p>Here is the place to say again, thanks to Natalya Revutska, I guess this is her project idea :) </p>
<p>The site is fully responsive, and there have been used components from MUI.</p>
<p>My contribution to the project is the following component directories: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Banner </li>
  <li> Header </li>
  <li> IconsElement </li>
</ul>
